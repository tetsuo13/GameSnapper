<p>Finally launched the initial version of GameSnapper on 2011-04-10. First
started in late November of 2010 and created little by little over that
period, opening with 288 games and little features.</p>

<p>The initial list of planned features was quite intense looking over it in
hindsight but many things had to be cut. Why cut features visitors may
like?</p>

<p>It's better to launch early omitting features not known to be useful and
listen to the needs of the visitors, adding features and omitting those that
were in the initial release. Launch early and iterate often!</p>

<p>So my first and foremost goal at this stage is to pay attention to what
people want, what they most often use, what they use least, and change
GameSnapper accordingly. I ask everyone who visits to drop me a line on the
good and the bad of their visit.</p>
