<p>One of my all-time biggest pet peeves when visiting other Flash gaming
sites on my laptop is how small the game is compared to everything else on the
screen. It's almost makes me squint my eyes.</p>

<p>This is why there is the full screen mode now on all games. Go to any game
and directly underneat in to the right is a link to "Full Screen Mode." This
will black everything else out and maximize the game to fit your screen.</p>
